For execution run : 

    1. npm run test-all-chrome - To run all tests in chrome
    2. npm run test-login-chrome - To run all tests from Login section
    3. npm run test-shopping-cart-chrome - To run all tests from Shopping cart section
    4. npm run test-checkout-chrome - To run all tests from Checkout section
    5. npm run test-all-multibrowser - To run all tests in a multibrowser option (will run the tests from the installed browsers on the local machine.

Following the same pattern as mentioned above , you can run the same modules but here each one of the instructions will create a json report in the ./reports/ section.

    2. npm run test-login-chrome-report
    3. npm run test-shopping-cart-chrome-report
